# Dynamic Generative Theory (DGT)

A novel physical paradigm for quantum measurement and cosmic evolution. Its core proposition is that quantum "collapse" is not an instantaneous event, but a finite-time **convergence process** during which the observer and the observed system **co-generate** a new stable structure within a shared "potential field" through dynamical interaction.

### 🎯 Core Proposition: A Single Coherent Logic Chain

**Eight predictions, one unified framework** – The experimental confirmation of any single prediction provides support for the entire theoretical structure.

**📄 View the full list of eight predictions:** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18150947](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18150947)

**Predictions of particular interest for experimental testing:**
- **Prediction 2:** Wavefunction "collapse" is in fact a finite-time convergence process with a lower time limit (~10⁻⁴⁴ s).
- **Prediction 3:** Custom entangled states can be "programmed" via specific sequences of constraints.
- **Prediction 4:** Applying strong, tailored constraints to a macroscopic object can briefly disrupt its classical behavior.
- **Prediction 7:** The fundamental scale of quantum processes (effective generative element `Ξ_eff`) is modulated by the local gravitational environment.

## 📖 Core Tenets

- **Beyond Collapse:** Replaces the instantaneous, non-dynamical wavefunction **collapse** postulate with a finite-time dynamical **convergence** process.
- **No External Observer:** The observer is an intrinsic part of the physical world. Measurement is a co-evolution of the system and the measuring apparatus.
- **Information as Existence:** "Reality" is defined by the dynamic generation and dissipation of stable information structures within the potential field.
- **The Universe as Computation:** Cosmic evolution can be viewed as an ongoing "computation" defined by physical laws and occurring within the potential field.

## 🔭 Key Features of the Theory

1.  **Mathematical Formalism:** Possesses a complete mathematical framework based on core constructs like the generative element `Ξ`, the coherence function `C(H)`, the mass generation coefficient `η`, and the geometric modulation factor `F(g)`.
2.  **Testable Predictions:** Proposes **eight** clear predictions testable by experiment or astronomical observation.
3.  **Open Source & Reproducible:** Provides complete cosmological simulation code. All results can be independently verified.
4.  **Connects to Existing Knowledge:** Designed to interface with established physics while offering a new terminological and conceptual framework.

## 🧠 Predictions and Empirical Tests

### Selected Predictions (Summary)

- **Prediction 2:** In particle collisions, significant anomalies in hadron production cross-sections or jet reconstruction may be observed when the center-of-mass energy approaches **~10.1 TeV** (corresponding to a "generation energy scale").
- **Prediction 3:** The entanglement decay curve for photon pairs traversing a specific distance (a coherence length scale) will deviate from standard exponential decay, showing resonance or plateau features related to **geometric structure**.
- **Prediction 7 (Gravitational Modulation):** The coherence time of quantum systems (e.g., cold atoms, superconducting qubits) is measurably longer in a weaker gravitational potential (e.g., on the ISS) compared to Earth's surface. **Preliminary qualitative support exists from NASA's Cold Atom Lab data.**

### How to Test DGT?
1.  **Run Simulations:** Reproduce the cosmological predictions (e.g., calculation of total universe lifespan).
2.  **Analyze Data:** Re-examine data from LHC, quantum optics, or quantum computing experiments in the energy ranges or frequency bands indicated by the predictions.
3.  **Theoretical Scrutiny:** Examine the mathematical self-consistency of the theory or explore its points of conflict/convergence with General Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, etc.

## 🌐 A Broader Research Program

Dynamic Generative Theory serves as the foundational **meta-framework** for an interconnected research program that spans:
- **Physics & Cosmology** (This repository)
- **Computer Science:** *Generative Complexity* and the P vs. NP problem
- **Cognitive Science:** *Generalized & Specialized Theories of Relational Intelligence*
- **Biology:** *A DGT perspective on the Origin of Life*
- **Mathematics:** The search for new formal tools to describe "generation" itself.

Each branch produces its own set of testable hypotheses, united by the core logic of dynamic generation.
